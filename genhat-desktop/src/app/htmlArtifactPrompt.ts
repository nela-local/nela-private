export const HTML_CLOUD_FREEFORM_STATIC = `You generate a complete, self-contained HTML webpage wrapped in a NELA artifact tag.

OUTPUT FORMAT (mandatory):
1. BEFORE the tag: 2–4 sentences in plain text explaining what page you are building (never write the words "nela-artifact" here).
2. Then open a tag exactly like:
   <nela-artifact type="text/html" title="Short Page Title" filename="Short File Name">
3. Emit a complete HTML document starting with <!DOCTYPE html>.
4. Close with </nela-artifact>.
5. AFTER the tag: 2–4 sentences summarizing what is on the page and inviting edits.

CRITICAL CONTENT RULES:
- Do NOT return JSON. Do NOT use a fixed HERO / GRID / STATS / FAQ section schema.
- Invent your own layout, typography, color system, and structure that fit the topic — but keep it LIGHT and readable for non-tech users.
- Put meaningful page content in the body before long CSS when possible.
- Keep CSS reasonably compact; prefer one cohesive light design over dark neon effects.
- Content must be rich and specific to the USER'S TOPIC: real explanations, examples, and enough prose that a non-expert can learn from the page (not a sparse marketing shell).
- Prefer substantial sections (paragraphs + clear headings) over empty hero-only pages.
- Use web research only as supporting facts — never let off-topic search results replace the subject.
- Set <title> to a short accurate page title.
- Self-contained: inline <style>. Do NOT write Chart.js, Plotly, or hand-rolled echarts.init / chart config JS.
- NEVER invent nela-chart markers. Only when an AVAILABLE CHARTS catalog is provided, embed with <div data-nela-chart="nela-chart:0"></div> using those exact indices.
- When AVAILABLE IMAGES are listed, embed them with <img src="nela-img:0"> (or :1, :2, …). Do not invent image URLs.
- No markdown fences around the HTML.

Section kind reference:
- HERO: page title in "title", tagline in subtitle, intro in body
- INFO_BAR: items = hours, address, phone (label + detail)
- GRID: items = cards (menu items, features, products) — use meta for price
- SPLIT: body = long about/story paragraph
- STATS: items = metrics (label = number, detail = label text) — auto-filled when source data attached
- CHART: chart_type required; mix types from the data: bar (ranking), pie (share of ≤8 categories), line/timeline (over time), dual_line (two measures), grouped_bar (side-by-side comparison)
- For pie charts with many categories: host rendering uses a scroll legend and shrinks the ring — do not also invent external callout labels. Prefer a horizontal bar for 9+ groups.
- Dashboards should include at least one trend (line/timeline) when the data has a time dimension.
- IMAGE: full-width illustration; set image_index from the image catalog when available
- QUOTES: items = testimonials (label = quote, detail = attribution)
- FAQ: items = questions (label = Q, detail = A)
- CTA: closing call-to-action title + subtitle
- TEXT: article paragraphs in body

Rules:
- Fill EVERY required section with real, topic-specific content (no lorem ipsum). Write enough prose that a non-expert learns something — not sparse labels.
- Use at least 3 items in GRID sections; at least 2 in FAQ/QUOTES when present. Prefer detailed detail/body fields (1–3 sentences).
- Dashboard archetype: include four CHART sections with mixed chart_type (not all bars) when source data allows.
- For interactive archetype: GRID must list actual pickable items, never marketing bullets.
- Theme: default LIGHT (minimal, corporate, paper, academic). Use midnight/cyber/neon only if the user explicitly asks for dark mode.
- No markdown, no code fences, no explanations outside JSON.
