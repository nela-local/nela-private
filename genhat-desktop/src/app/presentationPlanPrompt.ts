Schema:
{"slides":[{"title":"string","layout":"TITLE"|"SECTION"|"BULLET"|"TWO_COLUMN"|"IMAGE_LEFT"|"STAT"|"QUOTE"|"CARDS"|"COMPARISON"|"CENTERED","bullets":["string"],"notes":"string","left_title":"string","right_title":"string"}],"theme":"midnight"|"corporate"|"sunset"|"minimal"|"academic"|"cyber"|"ocean"|"forest"|"lavender"|"neon"|"rose"|"slate"}

Layouts (pick to fit content):
- TITLE: cover. bullets = subtitle + 1–2 concrete taglines (full sentences).
- SECTION: section divider with 1–3 real intro lines that teach the next chapter.
- BULLET: 4–6 bullets, each 15–40 words with a claim + brief explanation or example.
- TWO_COLUMN / IMAGE_LEFT: 4–6 concrete points with enough detail to stand alone.
- STAT: bullets[0] = headline metric/fact; then 2–3 supporting specifics. Prefer STAT when the topic has numbers.
- QUOTE: takeaway + attribution/context in plain language.
- CARDS: 3–4 items as "Label: 1–2 sentence specifics".
- COMPARISON: 3–5 points per side; left_title/right_title must be real domain terms (e.g. Classical vs Quantum), never "Primary approach".
- CENTERED: 2–4 short paragraphs of real takeaways (not a single vague line).
- IMAGE_LEFT: set image_index from the AVAILABLE IMAGES catalog when present.

Content rules:
- First slide TITLE; last slide CENTERED with a concrete takeaway about THIS topic.
- Slide 1–2 must DEFINE the topic (what it is / how it works) for a non-expert. Later slides need named examples (products, people, events, case studies — whatever fits).
- When statistics exist, include at least one STAT slide with real figures.
- Every bullet must be specifically about the user's topic. No vague fluff ("transformative potential", "continuous innovation") unless tied to a fact.
- Use ≥4 different layouts. Avoid Q&A / References / Final Thoughts unless asked.
- Theme: default to a LIGHT theme (minimal, academic, or corporate). Use midnight/cyber/neon only if the user explicitly asks for dark mode.

Content rules:
- Answer the USER'S REQUEST exactly. Never pivot to worksheets, crafts, card projects, or unrelated products.
- Pack each slide with concrete facts (names, dates, places, figures) and plain-language explanation. Bullets should be 15–40 words — not one-word stubs.
- First slide TITLE; later slides use varied layouts. Prefer 8–12 slides unless the user asked for a count.
- When statistics exist, include at least one STAT slide. When AVAILABLE IMAGES exist, use IMAGE_LEFT with image_index.
- Theme: prefer LIGHT (minimal, academic, corporate). Use dark themes only if the user explicitly asks.
- Set output_name to a short filename-friendly title.

/**
 * Cloud freeform HTML for capable models (Smart/Deep on paid tiers).
 */
export const PRESENTATION_CLOUD_HTML_STATIC = `You generate a complete, self-contained HTML slide presentation wrapped in a NELA artifact tag.

OUTPUT FORMAT (mandatory):
1. BEFORE the tag: 2–4 sentences in plain text explaining the deck (never write the words "nela-artifact" here).
2. Then:
   <nela-artifact type="text/html" title="Short Deck Title">
3. Emit a complete HTML document starting with <!DOCTYPE html>.
4. Close with </nela-artifact>.
5. AFTER the tag: 2–4 sentences summarizing slide coverage and inviting edits.

CRITICAL CONTENT RULES:
- Do NOT return JSON (no {"slides":...}). HTML only inside the artifact tag.
- WRITE ORDER (mandatory to avoid blank decks): put the full <body> with ALL slide markup and text FIRST, then a compact <style>, then <script>. Never write a long stylesheet before slide content.
- Keep CSS under ~80 lines. Prefer simple light layouts over elaborate dark gradients.
- Build a multi-slide deck with arrow-key / button navigation and a slide counter.
- Mark each slide with class="slide". First slide must include class="slide active" so something is visible immediately.
- Converter-friendly layout: each .slide is a 16:9 page (1280×720 or 1920×1080), box-sizing:border-box. Do not put a long scrolling document inside one slide. Size charts/SVG/canvas with explicit pixel width and height. Prefer solid light fills or soft linear-gradient (avoid black full-bleed backgrounds).
- Content must be RICH, specific, and easy for a non-expert to follow. Prefer 8–12 slides unless the user asked for a count.
- Body text on slides should be substantial: 4–6 detailed bullets or 2–3 short paragraphs per content slide — not sparse titles with empty space.
- When the topic has statistics, include STAT slides (headline metric + supporting bullets).
- Do NOT write Chart.js, Plotly, or hand-rolled echarts.init. When AVAILABLE CHARTS are listed, embed with <div data-nela-chart="nela-chart:0"></div> on relevant slides.
- When AVAILABLE IMAGES are listed, embed with <img src="nela-img:0"> on relevant slides (hero / IMAGE_LEFT style layouts). Never invent image URLs.
- Stay on the USER'S TOPIC. Ignore off-topic web results (worksheets, crafts, product listings).
- Set <title> to a short accurate deck title.
- No markdown fences around the HTML.
